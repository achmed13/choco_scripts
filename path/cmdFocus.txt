CmdFocus ver. 1.1 (c) 2008-2010, Horst Schaeffer
------------------------------------------------

CmdFocus brings the current console window to the foreground and sets the keyboard focus *). CmdFocus also offers an option to minimize the console window.

When a batch is running in the background or minimized, and you want to see the results when the job is done, insert CmdFocus followed by PAUSE. This will bring the console window to your attention, and allow any key to continue the batch (to close the console, for example). 

Options (space between command, options):

   /beep      Windows default sound
   /center    center console window on desktop
   /min       minimize the console window (the other options are ignored)
   /(value)   milliseconds to wait before continuing batch process, e.g. /5000

*) Note: The console window may NOT get the keyboard focus, if Windows is set up to
"Prevent applications from stealing focus". Please test.
